This repo contains code for running a 4x4x4 (64 total) [multiplexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) LED cube.

4 LED's are wired into columns using their annode. 16 columns are then wired together creating the cube, connecting each layer (16 LEDs) together by their cathode. By keeping each layer & column disconnected, individual LED's can be toggled on by connecting the desired column & layer. Multiple LEDs can be turned on at once by individually blinking each LED faster than the eye can see. By rendering multiple "frames" in quick succession patterns can be created on the cube.

Animations are run using an [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano).
