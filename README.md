# Animated Cube

Arduino code to animate a 4x4x4 LED matrix using [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing)

64 LEDs have had each anode wired together in columns and each cathode wired in planes. By controling which column & plane has power an individual LED can be controlled. Using this method called _multiplexing_, several LEDs can be flashed on and off to create animations.
