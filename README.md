# Animated Cube
Using [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) 64 LEDs have been wired into a 4x4x4 matrix. This 
allows for individual control of each LED by controlling a combination of 20 different inputs.

By quickly blinking different lights in a sequence, 3D animations can be created by the matrix.
